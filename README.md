A website and JSON API that allows npm expansions to be generated and searched. An NPM expansion represents the words with make up the NPM acronym e.g. "Nice People Meet".

The website supports mobile, is written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS, its assets compiled using [rust]((https://www.rust-lang.org/)), and served via [NGINX]((https://www.nginx.com/)). The JSON API is built using rust. Both the JSON API and NGINX server are deployed using [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and hosted via [fly.io](https://fly.io/).

# üß≠ Project Goals
- To learn about rust as a language, specifically ownership and type rules
- To learn about the nitty-gritty details of the HTTP protocol
- To learn about docker deployment
- To learn about the nginx web server and reverse proxies

# üó∫Ô∏è Understanding the project
The rust JSON web server is found in the `npm-expansions` directory while the nginx web server and rust project compiles static files is found in the `nginx-reverse-proxy` directory.

## Rust JSON web server
The JSON web server is located within the `npm-expansions` directory and is responsible for serving JSON responses via TCP to routes with the prefix `/api`.

The project roughly adheres to a model, view, controller ([MVC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC)) architecture. The project has two controllers (`DefaultController`, `NpmController`), one model (`ExpansionsModel`) and one "view" in the sense that all responses are in JSON format.

The project can understood using a top down approach starting with the `main.rs` file. The following diagram attempts an explanation:

## Nginx static site and reverse proxy
The nginx server is responsible for serving the static site and reverse proxying requests to the JSON web server. The nginx server itself is configured by `npm-expansions.conf` for production and `npm-expansions.dev.conf` for development.

The rust project within `nginx-reverse-proxy` is responsible for compiling the assets within the `pages` and `static` directories which involves injecting environment variables into `HTML` files and performing minification on all `CS`, `JS`, and `HTML` files. After injection and minification the assets are placed into directories called `minified_pages` and `minified_static` directories.

<br>

# üïπÔ∏è Usage
The static website can be accessed at `https://www.npm-expansions.com` and requests to the JSON API can be made to `https://npm-expansions.com/api`. The JSON API supports the following routes:
- `GET /api/random` - Returns a random expansion in the format 
  ```json
  { "npm-expansion": "Nonce Pseudo Manager" }
  ```
- `GET /api/all` - Returns all npm expansions in array format
  ```json
  ["Nobody Pieces Moons", "Nibble Pickles Matches"]
  ```
- `GET /api/search?query=abc` - Returns the top 10 matching expansions to the provided search query in array format
  ```json
  ["Nobody Pieces Moons", "Nibble Pickles Matches"]
  ```

# üîß Development
To develop this project first ensure you have the following programs installed:
- A rust nightly build
- Docker

Then follow the steps below:
1. Navigate to the `npm-expansions` directory and start the web server with the command `DEV=true cargo run`
2. Start docker
3. Start the reverse proxy and static site by running the following command from the root of the project `docker-compose up --build`

<br>

# üõ∞Ô∏è Deployment
This project is configured to be deployed to [fly.io](https://fly.io/) via two docker containers. To deploy follow the steps below:
- Ensure you have a fly.io account
- Ensure you have authenticated via the fly.io CLI
- Create two fly.io Apps by using the command `fly launch` and using the names `npm-expansions` and `npm-expansions-reverse-proxy`
- Navigate to the nginx-reverse-proxy directory and run the command `flyctl deploy --remote-only --build-arg UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID=${{ secrets.UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID }} UMAMI_WEBSITE_URL=${{ secrets.UMAMI_WEBSITE_URL }}`
- Navigate to the npm-expansions directory and run the command `fly deploy`

# üåü Credits
As you may have noticed this project is heavily inspired by the official [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) site and expansions [repository](https://github.com/npm/npm-expansions). I am a fan of NPM and created this project in good faith as a way to promote NPM. If anyone from NPM has issues with this site please do not hesitate to contact me at `james[at]jameswatt.io`.

# üìã Future Features List
- Handle incoming requests in an optimized way e.g. threads or asynchronous events
- Add server logs for each request and failure
- Dynamically update the `expansions.txt` file and the global `ExpansionsModel`.
  - This could be done by a separate thread which routinely checks the official npm expansions repo and pull requests
  - Note that the last change to the expansions text file in the official repo occurred two years ago.
- Implement a background rain animation effect similar to the header of [deno merch](https://merch.deno.com/)
- Implement environment variables for the static site
  - Specifically for analytics tracking codes
